    <h2 style="color: blue;">Internet</h1>
        <h2 style="color: skyblue;">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h2>
        <p>
            This article is about the worldwide computer network. For other uses, see Internet
            (disambiguation).
        </p>
        <p>Not to be confused with the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The <b>Internet</b> is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the
            standard Internet protocol suite(TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide. It is a
            <i style="color: red;">network of networks</i> that consists of millions of private, public, academic,
            business,
            and government networks
            of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking
            technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such
            as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web(WWW),
            the infrastructure to support email, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing and telephony.
        </p>
        <p>The origins of the Internet date back to research commissioned by the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_government"
                style="text-decoration:none; color: black;">United States
                government</a> in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via computer
            networks.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#cite_note-2"
                style="text-decoration:none; color: black;">[2]</a> This work, combined with work in the United Kingdom
            and France, led to the primary
            precursor network, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET"
                style="text-decoration:none; color: black;">ARPANET</a>, in the United States. A 1980 paper refers to
            "the ARPA
            internet". <a style="color: red;">The interconnection of regional academic networks in the 1980s marks the
                beginning of
                the transition to the modern Internet.</a> From the early 1990s, the network experienced sustained
            exponential growth as generations of institutional,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer"
                style="text-decoration:none; color: black;">personal</a>, and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_device" style="text-decoration:none; color: black;">mobile</a>
            computers were
            connected to it.
