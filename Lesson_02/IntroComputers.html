    <h2>History of Computers</h2>
    <p>One of the earliest machines designed to assist people in calculations was the <b>abacus</b> which is still being
        used some 5000 years after its invention.</p>
    <p>In 1642 Blaise Pascal(a famous French mathematician) invented anadding machine based on mechanical gears in which
        numbers were represented by the cogs on the wheels.</p>
    <p>Englishman, Charles Babbage, invented in the 1830's a "Difference Engine" made out ofbrass and pewter rods and
        gears, and also designed a further device which he called an"Analytical Engine". His design contained the five
        key characteristics of modern computers:-</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An input device</li>
        <li>Storage for numbers waiting to be processed</li>
        <li>A processor or number calculator</li>
        <li>A unit to control the task and the sequence of its calculations</li>
        <li>An output device</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Augusta Ada Byron <i>(later Countess of Lovelace)</i> was an associate of Babbage who hasbecome known as thefirst
        computer programmer.</p>
    <h2>Computer parts</h2>
    <h3>Centual Processing Unit</h3>
    <p>A <b>central processing unit(CPU)</b> is the electronic circuitrywithin acomputer that carries out the
        instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output(I/O)
        operations specified by the instructions. The computer industry has used the term "central processing unit" at
        least since the early 1960s.[1]

    <h3>Keyboard</h3>

    <p>A computer keyboard is a typewriter-style device which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as
        mechanical levers or
        electronic switches. Following the decline of punch cards and paper tape, interaction via teleprinter-style
        keyboards became the
        main input method for computers.Keyboard keys (buttons) typically have characters engraved or printed on
        them,[2] and each press
        of a key typically corresponds to a single written symbol. However, producing some symbols may require
        pressing
        and holding
        several keys simultaneously or in sequence.While most keyboard keys produce letters, numbers or signs
        (characters), other keys or
        simultaneous key presses can produce actions or execute computer commands. In normal usage, the keyboard is
        used
        as a text entry interface for typing text
        and numbers into a word processor, text editor or any other program. In a modern computer, the
        interpretation of
        key presses is generally left to the software. A
        computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to the
        controlling software.
